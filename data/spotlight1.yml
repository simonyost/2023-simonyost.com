  By the time delivery is visibly failing, the system has already been under strain for months.

  It usually looks like this:
  <ul>
  <li>Teams are shipping, but progress feels fragile</li>
  <li>Estimates keep expanding without clear explanation</li>
  <li>Ownership is distributed, but accountability is unclear</li>
  <li>Decisions take longer, even when everyone agrees</li>
  <li>Cloud and tooling costs rise faster than confidence</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These are not people problems. They are system problems.
  <p>Left unaddressed, these signals compound—not gradually, but suddenly.
