title : "Start With a Short Diagnostic, Not a Long Engagement"
content: |
  Most engagements begin with a focused diagnostic.
  Over a short window, we examine:
  <ul>
  <li>Where execution is breaking down</li>
  <li>What is driving cost and delivery risk</li>
  <li>Which decisions are unclear or misowned</li>
  <li>What to fix now versus later</li>
  </ul> 

  <p>You leave with an executive-level readout and a clear recommendation on whether deeper advisory work makes sense.</p>
