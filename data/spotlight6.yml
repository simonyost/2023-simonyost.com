  <p>When execution systems are realigned, the results compound quickly:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Multi-million-dollar annual cloud cost reductions</li>
  <li>Elimination of recurring reliability regressions</li>
  <li>Faster scaling during high-risk events</li>
  <li>Improved delivery predictability without adding headcount</li>
  </ul> 

  <p>Without intervention, these same systems usually respond by hiring more, spending more, and trusting less.</p>

  <p>The common thread is not effort. It is alignment.</p>
