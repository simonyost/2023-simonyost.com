title : "The Bottleneck Shifts Before Anyone Notices"
content: |
  <p>At scale, execution fails upstream of delivery.</p>

  <p>The real constraints become:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>How decisions are made</li>
  <li>Who owns cross-cutting outcomes</li>
  <li>How tradeoffs are surfaced and resolved</li>
  <li>Whether cost, reliability, and speed are governed intentionally</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When these mechanisms are weak, teams compensate with heroics. That works until it doesn’t.</p>
