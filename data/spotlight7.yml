title : "The First Step Is a Short Diagnostic — Not a Commitment"
content: |
  <p>Most engagements begin with a focused diagnostic.
  <br>Over a short window, we examine:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Where execution is breaking down</li>
  <li>What is driving cost and delivery risk</li>
  <li>Which decisions are unclear or misowned</li>
  <li>What to fix now versus later</li>
  </ul> 

  <p>You leave with an executive-level readout and a clear recommendation on whether deeper advisory work makes sense.</p>
  <p>Not every situation warrants deeper engagement. The diagnostic is how we determine that quickly.
  It is designed to create clarity, not lock you into a longer engagement.</p>
