title : "The Real Problem"
content: |
  At scale, execution fails upstream of delivery.

  The real constraints become:
  <ul>
  <li>How decisions are made</li>
  <li>Who owns cross-cutting outcomes</li>
  <li>How tradeoffs are surfaced and resolved</li>
  <li>Whether cost, reliability, and speed are governed intentionally</li>
  </ul>

  When these mechanisms are weak, teams compensate with heroics. That works until it doesn’t.
