title : I Work at the Decision Layer, Not the Task Layer
content: |
  <p>My role is not to manage tickets or deliver features.
  <br>I work with executives to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Clarify ownership across product, engineering, and data</li>
  <li>Reduce decision latency and escalation paths</li>
  <li>Align architecture and operating rhythms to business reality</li>
  <li>Restore predictability without slowing momentum</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is system-level intervention, not task execution.</p>
