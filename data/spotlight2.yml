title : "Hiring Faster Doesn’t Fix a Broken Execution System"
content: |
  <p>Early on, more capacity helps. Shared context is high, coordination is cheap, and most work is parallelizable.</p>

  <p>That math breaks as systems scale.</p>

  <p>Past a certain point, every additional engineer increases coordination cost, decision latency, and dependency load. Hiring amplifies unclear priorities and weak ownership models.</p>

  <p>When leadership solves for capacity instead of system design, execution slows even as headcount grows.</p>

  <p>This is how organizations double spend and halve predictability without realizing why.</p>
