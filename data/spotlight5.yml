title : This Is Advisory Work, Not Staff Augmentation
content: |
  This work is not a fit if you are looking for:
  
  <ul>
  <li>Extra hands to increase throughput</li>
  <li>A generic AI or cloud strategy</li>
  <li>A long roadmap deck without accountability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is a fit when leadership wants clarity, leverage, and fewer late surprises as systems scale.</p>

  <p>Execution remains with your teams. I help ensure the system they are operating inside actually works.</p>
