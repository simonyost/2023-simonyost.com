title : "When Execution Stops Scaling, More Resources Make It Worse"
subtitle: |
  I help leadership teams realign product, engineering, data, and cost when complexity breaks execution.
content : |

  <br>It fails quietly—through slower decisions, fragile delivery, and rising cost masked as “growth.”
  <p>That is not a capacity problem. It is a system problem.
